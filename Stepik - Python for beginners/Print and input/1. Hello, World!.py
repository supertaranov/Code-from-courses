# Task 1:
# Write a program that displays the text "Hello, World!" (without quotes).
# Note 1. The checking system will compare the result 
# of your program and the correct answer is character-by-character. 
# This means that you need to output exactly the line that is specified in the task condition.
# Note 2. The checking system uses the standard output (stdout, command print()).

print('Hello, World!')

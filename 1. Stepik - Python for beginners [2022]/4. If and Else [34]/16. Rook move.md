There are two different squares on a chessboard. Write a program that determines whether the rook can get from the first square to the second one in a single move. The program receives four numbers from 1 to 8 each, giving the column number and row number first for the first square and then for the second square. The program should output "YES" if the rook can be moved from the first square to the second, or "NO" otherwise.

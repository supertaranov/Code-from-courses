# As you know, integers in Python do not have the limitations found in other programming languages. 
# Write a program that reads four positive integers a, b, c, and d 
# and displays the value of the expression a**b + c**d .

# Input Data Format:
# The input to the program is four positive integers a, b, c and d
# each on a separate line in the order given.

# Output format:
# The program has to output the value.

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
d = int(input())
print(a**b + c**d)
